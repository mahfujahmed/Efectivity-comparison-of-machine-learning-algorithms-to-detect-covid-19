# Efectivity-comparison-of-machine-learning-algorithms-to-detect-covid-19
This project uses machine learning to predict COVID-19 infection based on symptoms and clinical data. It compares models like Decision Tree, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, and Neural Network to enable faster, safer, and more accessible screening.
